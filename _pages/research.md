* **In Search of Working Time? Hours Constraints and Firms** [Draft available upon request]

&nbsp;
_This paper focuses on hours constraints, the inability for employees to work their preferred number of hours at a given wage rate. While previous research has often depicted these constraints as related to firm-specific hours policies, little evidence exists to support this view as data on constraints remain scarce. Exploiting a unique feature of the French Labor Force Survey, I link the majority of workers reporting their constraints to panel administrative data and provide new insights regarding the role of firms in hours constraints. First, relying on a decomposition approach, I confirm that occupational sorting explains the majority of variation in constraint probability, while further demonstrating that firm sorting accounts for 73% of the remaining variation. Within constraining jobs, I identify a significant hours gap between constrained and unconstrained workers, sometimes in the same firm, and investigate potential mechanisms driving this disparity. Second, I exploit the panel dimension of my linked data to study labor market transitions of constrained workers. I observe a higher probability to move across employers for constrained workers. When such transitions occur, these workers experience larger increases in hours worked and consequently higher earnings, as the effect on hourly wages remains flat._

_90% of French workers have a working contract stipulating a given number of hours of work per week. Their employer has the duty to control these hours and if workers do overtime, overtime hours must be paid. The remaining 10% of the French workforce are paid per working day. This means that they have to work a given number of days per year, but their hours are not monitored. Employers can use the later contracts (by the day) only for high-skill workers who have strong autonomy in their job. Combining administrative and survey data at the individual level, we show that 20% of the workforce think that they are paid by the day while they are actually paid through a classic hours contract. This reveals that several workers do not know the legal environment governing something as fundamental as their working time. A first contribution is to document this phenomenon: we study the characteristics of the workers (and their firms) that are not aware of their working contract (and presumably their rights). Second, we examine if these misreporters differ from classic workers in terms of working conditions, typically whether they endorse the costs or enjoy the benefits of the flexible arrangement._
